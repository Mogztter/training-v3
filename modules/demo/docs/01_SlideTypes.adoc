Being a declarative language, Cypher focuses on the clarity of expressing *what* to retrieve from a graph, not on *how* to retrieve it.
You can think of Cypher as mapping English language sentence structure to patterns in a graph.

== Guided Exercise: Creating a new database

. In Neo4j Browser, select the system database.
. Create the new movies database in the query edit pane with `CREATE DATABASE Movies`
. Enter the browser command `:dbs` in the query edit pane to see the list of existing databases.
. Enter the browser command `:use movies` to switch to this newly created, empty database.

Suppose you have a graph that contains _Customer_ and _Product_ nodes. A _Customer_ node can have a _BOUGHT_ relationship with a _Product_ node.
_Customer_ nodes can have other relationships with _Product_ nodes.
A _Customer_ node has a property named _customerName_.
A _Product_ node has a property named _productName_.
What Cypher query do you execute to return all of the products (by name) bought by customer 'ABCCO'.

[%interactive.answers]
- [ ] [src-cypher]`MATCH (c:Customer {customerName: 'ABCCO'}) RETURN c.BOUGHT.productName`
- [ ] [src-cypher]`MATCH (:Customer 'ABCCO')-[:BOUGHT]->(p:Product) RETURN p.productName`
- [ ] [src-cypher]`MATCH (p:Product)<-[:BOUGHT_BY]-(:Customer 'ABCCO') RETURN p.productName`
- [x] [src-cypher]`MATCH (:Customer {customerName: 'ABCCO'})-[:BOUGHT]->(p:Product) RETURN p.productName`
