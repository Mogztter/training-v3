== Neo4j for Graph Data Science

[.notes]
--
Neo4j for Graph Data Science is a toolbox that combines a native graph analytics workspace and graph database with scalable graph algorithms and graph visualization for a reliable, easy-to-use experience.
This framework enables data scientists to confidently operationalize better analytics and machine learning models that infer behavior based on connected data and network structures.

[square]
* Neo4j is a native graph database, built from the ground up to leverage not only data but also data relationships.
* Neo4j connects data as it is stored, enabling queries never before imagined, at speeds never thought possible.

Neo4j Bloom is an easy-to-use graph exploration application for visually interacting with Neo4j graphs.

[.notes]
--
Bloom gives graph novices and experts the ability to visually investigate and explore their graph data from different business perspectives.
Its illustrative, codeless search-to-visualization design makes it the ideal interface for fostering communication between peers, managers and executives, where they can share the innovative work of their graph development and analytics teams.

=== Graph Data Science Library

[.notes]
--
The Neo4j Graph Data Science Library (GDSL) contains many graph algorithms.
The algorithms are divided into categories which represent different problem classes:
--

[square]
* *Path Finding* - these algorithms help find the shortest path or evaluate the availability and quality of routes.

* *Centrality* - these algorithms determine the importance of distinct nodes in a network.

* *Community Detection* - these algorithms evaluate how a group is clustered or partitioned, as well as its tendency to strengthen or break apart.

* *Similarity* - these algorithms help calculate the similarity of nodes.

* *Link Prediction* - these algorithms determine the closeness of pairs of nodes.

* *Node Embeddings* - these algorithms compute vector representations of nodes in a graph.

These graph algorithms help to effectively answer questions about your dataâ€™s connectivity or topology, or generate new and highly predictive features for your existing ML pipelines.
At this writing, the the GDSL contains more than 50 graph algorithms.

==== Three tiers of graph algorithm maturity

[.notes]
--
Algorithms exist in one of three tiers of maturity:
--

*Production-quality*

Indicates that the algorithm has been tested with regards to stability and scalability. Algorithms in this tier are prefixed with `gds.<algorithm>` and are supported by Neo4j.

*Beta*

Indicates that the algorithm is a candidate for the production-quality tier. Algorithms in this tier are prefixed with `gds.beta.<algorithm>`.

*Alpha*

Indicates that the algorithm is experimental and might be changed or removed at any time. Algorithms in this tier are prefixed with `gds.alpha.<algorithm>`.
