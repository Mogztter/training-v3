= Exercise #9: Install a plugin
// for local preview
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: ../../images]

In this Exercise, you will install the APOC library for use by your Neo4j instance and you will create and execute a script to report all of the procedures available to the Neo4j instance.

== Before you begin

. Make sure you have a terminal window open to your Docker Neo4j instance for this course.
. Stop the Docker Neo4j instance.

== Exercise steps:

. In a Web browser, go to the GitHub repository for the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures[APOC library].
. Find the latest release of the library that is compatible with the version of Neo4j Enterprise Edition you are working with.
. Download the already-built *.jar* file into the *$HOME/docker-neo4j/neo4j/plugins* directory.
+
In OS X and Linux:
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
cd $HOME/docker-neo4j/neo4j/plugins
----
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
curl -L <URL for the jar file> > <name of the jar file>
----
+
[start=4]
. Make sure this *.jar* file has execute permissions.
. Modify */etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf* to allow (sandbox) all procedures of the APOC library.
+

[source,config,role=noplay]
----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=apoc.*
----

. Start the Neo4j instance.
. View the log to ensure the instance started with no problems.
. Using `cypher-shell` write a command to create the procedures.txt file that contains all of the procedures that are loaded for the Neo4j instance.
+
On OS X and Linux:
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
echo "CALL dbms.procedures YIELD name;" | docker exec --interactive neo4j bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <your password> --format plain --database maindb > $HOME/docker-neo4j/neo4j/logs/reports/procedures.txt
----
+
On Windows:
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
echo CALL dbms.procedures YIELD name; | docker exec --interactive neo4j bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <your password> --format plain --database maindb > %HOMEPATH%\docker-neo4j\neo4j\logs\reports\procedures.txt
----

[start=9]
. Confirm that APOC procedures are loaded by examining the file produced.

== Exercise summary

You have now configured a Neo4j instance so that applications that access the databases can use APOC library procedures.
