ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: ../../images]

We are using Neo4j Enterprise Edition for the hands-on exercises in this training, as some Neo4j features are not included in Community Edition.
The OS that we will use for this training is Debian.
In your real application environment, the location of files for managing Neo4j and the terminal commands will be different.
Neo4j Enterprise Edition is available for download with a 30-day evaluation license.
