== Exercise 14: Monitoring queries (Preparations)

*1. Verify that your Neo4j Browser session has access to the APOC library by executing the Cypher below*:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL dbms.procedures()
YIELD name
WHERE name STARTS WITH 'apoc.'
RETURN name ORDER BY name ASC
----

If this code does not return the list of APOC procedures, then you must ensure that the APOC library is available by installing the plugin (Neo4j Desktop) and restarting the database as follows:

. Make sure Neo4j Desktop is online.
. In Neo4j Desktop for the project you are working with, click  *Add Plugin*.
. Select the install button for APOC.
. Click the Install button.
. Close the Add Plugin window.
. Start or restart the database.

*2. This exercise assumes that you have a fully-loaded movie database with the `Genre` nodes. Execute this code to reset the database:*

[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/AfterImportDenormalizedData.cypher[]
----

*Note*: This reset script will fail if you have fulltext schema indexes in the database.
Before you run this script, you must run this code to drop the fulltext schema indexes:

[source, cypher]
----
call db.index.fulltext.drop('Roles');
call db.index.fulltext.drop('MovieTitle')
----

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

*3. In this exercise, you will be running queries as you have done so in your Neo4j Browser.
In order to monitor queries, you must open a Web browser and start another Neo4j Browser session.
In most cases, you should be able to enter this address to connect to your started database:*

https://localhost:7474

*If this port has changed, it will be specified in the settings for the database and you should use those settings.*

*If you can successfully open Neo4j Browser at a particular port, simply enter the password for the ndo4j user and you should be ready to monitor any queries you are executing in your other Neo4j Browser window.*

*Here is what a Web browser should appear as if you have correctly connected to the started database:*

== Exercise 14: Monitoring queries (Overview)

In this exercise, you gain more experience monitoring queries and using the Query Log Analyzer tool.

In this exercise, you will:

* *Exercise 14.1*: Monitor and kill a long-running query.
* *Exercise 14.2*: Prepare for query logging.
* *Exercise 14.3*: Install the Query Log Analyzer Tool.
* *Exercise 14.4*: Execute some queries that will be logged.
* *Exercise 14.5*: View the queries logged using the Query Log Analyzer Tool.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Exercise 14.1: Monitor and kill a long-running query. (Instructions)

Here is a query that will run for a long time:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) RETURN count(id(a))
----

*1. Execute this query in the Neo4j Browser session (main session) you have used throughout this training.*

*2. In the monitoring Neo4j Browser session you started in a different window, monitor the queries using the `:queries` command.*

*3. In the monitoring Neo4j Browser session, kill the query that you started above in the Neo4j Browser display shown for `:queries` command.*

*4. Repeat the query again that runs for a long time in your main Neo4j Browser session.*

*5. In the monitoring Neo4j Browser session, call the cypher procedure to list the queries and return the query and the query ID.*

*6. In the monitoring Neo4j Browser session, call the cypher procedure to kill the query.*


== Exercise 14.1: Monitor and kill a long-running query. (Solution)

Here is a query that will run for a long time:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) RETURN count(id(a))
----

*1. Execute this query in the Neo4j Browser session (main session) you have used throughout this training.*

*2. In the monitoring Neo4j Browser session you started in a different window, monitor the queries using the `:queries` command.*

This is what you should see:

[.thumb]
image::EX14.1.png[EX14.1,width=700]

*3. In the monitoring Neo4j Browser session, kill the query that you started above in the Neo4j Browser display shown for `:queries` command.*

You should select the query to kill and kill it as shown here:

[.thumb]
image::EX14.1B.png[EX14.1B,width=700]

You should see this in your main Neo4j Browser session:

[.thumb]
image::EX14.1C.png[EX14.1C,width=700]

*4. Repeat the query again that runs for a long time in your main Neo4j Browser session.*

*5. In the monitoring Neo4j Browser session, call the cypher procedure to list the queries and return the query and the query ID.*

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL dbms.listQueries() YIELD query, queryId, elapsedTimeMillis
----

The result of executing this code should be:

[.thumb]
image::EX14.1D.png[EX14.1D,width=700]

*6. In the monitoring Neo4j Browser session, call the cypher procedure to kill the query.*

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL dbms.listQueries() YIELD query, queryId, elapsedTimeMillis
WHERE query STARTS WITH 'MATCH' AND elapsedTimeMillis > 5000
CALL dbms.killQuery(queryId) YIELD queryId as qid, message
RETURN "Query: " + " " +  qid +" " + message as result
----

The result of executing this code should be:

[.thumb]
image::EX14.1E.png[EX14.1E,width=700]

And again you should see the failure in your main Neo4j Browser session.

== Exercise 14.2: Prepare for query logging. (Instructions)

*Add these settings to enable query logging:*

*Hint*: You can add them to the end of the settings file.

....
dbms.logs.query.enabled=true
# If the execution of query takes more time than this threshold,
# the query is logged. If set to zero then all queries
dbms.logs.query.threshold=100ms
dbms.logs.query.parameter_logging_enabled=true
dbms.logs.query.time_logging_enabled=true
dbms.logs.query.allocation_logging_enabled=true
dbms.logs.query.page_logging_enabled=true
dbms.track_query_cpu_time=true
dbms.track_query_allocation=true
....

== Exercise 14.2: Prepare for query logging.  (Solution)

*Add these settings to enable query logging:*

*Hint*: You can add them to the end of the settings file.

. In Neo4j Desktop click *Manage* for the currently running database.
. Click the *Settings* tab.
. Add the following code to the end of this file.

....
dbms.logs.query.enabled=true
# If the execution of query takes more time than this threshold,
# the query is logged. If set to zero then all queries
dbms.logs.query.threshold=100ms
dbms.logs.query.parameter_logging_enabled=true
dbms.logs.query.time_logging_enabled=true
dbms.logs.query.allocation_logging_enabled=true
dbms.logs.query.page_logging_enabled=true
dbms.track_query_cpu_time=true
dbms.track_query_allocation=true
....

[start=4]
. Click *Apply*. You need not restart the database yet as you will be restarting it after you install the Query Log Analyzer tool.

You should now see this in your Neo4j Desktop:
