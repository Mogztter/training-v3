== Exercise 15: Monitoring locking (Preparations)

*1. Verify that your Neo4j Browser session has access to the APOC library by executing the Cypher below*:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL dbms.procedures()
YIELD name
WHERE name STARTS WITH 'apoc.'
RETURN name ORDER BY name ASC
----

If this code does not return the list of APOC procedures, then you must ensure that the APOC library is available by installing the plugin (Neo4j Desktop) and restarting the database as follows:

. Make sure Neo4j Desktop is online.
. In Neo4j Desktop for the project you are working with, click  *Add Plugin*.
. Select the install button for APOC.
. Click the Install button.
. Close the Add Plugin window.
. Start or restart the database.

*2. This exercise assumes that you have a fully-loaded movie database with the `Genre` nodes. Execute this code to reset the database:*

[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/AfterImportDenormalizedData.cypher[]
----

*Note*: This reset script will fail if you have fulltext schema indexes in the database.
Before you run this script, you must run this code to drop the fulltext schema indexes:

[source, cypher]
----
call db.index.fulltext.drop('Roles');
call db.index.fulltext.drop('MovieTitle')
----

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

*3. In this exercise, you will be running queries as you have done so in your main Neo4j Browser session.
In order to monitor locking, you must open a Web browser and start another Neo4j Browser session.
If you have done this for the previous exercise, you should be all set and you can ignore the rest of these setup instructions.*

*In most cases, you should be able to enter this address to connect to your started database:*

https://localhost:7474

*If this port has changed, it will be specified in the settings for the database and you should use those settings.*

*If you can successfully open Neo4j Browser at a particular port, simply enter the password for the ndo4j user and you should be ready to monitor any queries you are executing in your other Neo4j Browser window.*

*Here is what a Web browser should appear as if you have correctly connected to the started database:*

== Exercise 15: Monitoring locking (Overview)

In this exercise, you gain more experience monitoring locking in a multi-user environment.

In this exercise, you will:

* *Exercise 15.1*: Execute code that holds a write lock on a node.
* *Exercise 15.2*: Execute code that attempts to lock the same node.
* *Exercise 15.3*: Write code to monitor locking.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Exercise 15.1: Execute code that holds a write lock on a node. (Instructions)

Here is code that holds a lock on a node for a long time (200 seconds).

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Actor)
WHERE a.name = 'Doris Day'
SET a.died= 2019
WITH a
call apoc.util.sleep(200000)
RETURN a.died
----

*Execute this code in your main Neo4j Browser session.*

== Exercise 15.1: Execute code that holds a write lock on a node. (Solution)

Here is code that holds a lock on a node for a long time (200 seconds).

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Actor)
WHERE a.name = 'Doris Day'
SET a.died= 2019
WITH a
call apoc.util.sleep(200000)
RETURN a.died
----

*Execute this code in your main Neo4j Browser session.*

This is what you should see:

== Exercise 15.2: Execute code that attempts to lock the same node. (Instructions)

*1. In the monitoring Neo4j Browser session, execute this code that attempts to lock the same node:*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Actor)
WHERE a.name = 'Doris Day'
SET a.died= 2000
RETURN a.died
----

*When you run this code, it will hang because it is waiting for the other client to release the lock on the node.*

*2. Terminate this query in the monitoring Neo4j Browser session by simply click the "X" in the top right corner of the window.*

== Exercise 15.2: Execute code that attempts to lock the same node. (Solution)

*1. In the monitoring Neo4j Browser session, execute this code that attempts to lock the same node:*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Actor)
WHERE a.name = 'Doris Day'
SET a.died= 2000
RETURN a.died
----

*When you run this code, it will hang because it is waiting for the other client to release the lock on the node.*

*2. Terminate this query in the monitoring Neo4j Browser session by simply click the "X" in the top right corner of the window.*

== Exercise 15.3: Write code to monitor locking. (Instructions)

The update should complete in the main Neo4j Browser window. Next, you will prepare to monitor locking.

*1. In the monitoring Neo4j Browser session, write code to monitor locking.*

*2. In the main Neo4j Browser window, recall the last statement and re-execute it to hold the write lock for 200 seconds.*

*3. In the monitoring Neo3j Browser session, execute the code to monitor locking.*

== Exercise 15.3: Write code to monitor locking. (Solution)

The update should complete in the main Neo4j Browser window. Next, you will prepare to monitor locking.

*1. In the monitoring Neo4j Browser session, write code to monitor locking.*

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL dbms.listTransactions() YIELD currentQueryId , currentQuery
WHERE currentQuery STARTS WITH "MATCH (a:Actor)"
CALL dbms.listActiveLocks(currentQueryId) YIELD mode, resourceType
RETURN mode, resourceType
----

*2. In the main Neo4j Browser window, recall the last statement and re-execute it to hold the write lock for 200 seconds.*

*3. In the monitoring Neo3j Browser session, execute the code to monitor locking.*

You should see something like this:

== Exercise 15: Taking it further

. Try locking contention with three users.
. Write code to kill the query found with the lock.

== Exercise 15: Monitoring queries   (Summary)

In this exercise, you gained experience with monitoring locks.

Congratulations! You have completed the exercises for this course.
