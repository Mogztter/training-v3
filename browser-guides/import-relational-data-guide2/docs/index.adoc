Welcome to this _Browser Guide_!

This is the interface for learning about Graph Data Modeling fo Neo4j.

Navigate through the tutorial by pressing the forward button at the right of the window.

We start by walking you through some preparations and instructions.

=== Pin a window

It is useful to pin the Browser Guide to the top, so that it doesn't scroll down when you execute statements.
You do this by pressing the _pin_ button in the upper right corner of the page: image:pin-button.png[]
Pressing it once more will _unpin_ the window again: image:unpin-button.png[].
