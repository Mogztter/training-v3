== Exercise 2: Getting started with the airport graph data model (Preparations)

You will now work with the airport graph data model.

*Execute the following Cypher statement to delete nodes and relationships in the graph:*

MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n

== Exercise 2: Getting started with the airport graph data model (Overview)

For the remaining exercises in this course, you will be working with data related to flights and airports.
In this exercise, you will create nodes and relationships that reflect our very simple  model that has an airport entity.

Here are the tasks for this exercise:

* *Exercise 2.1*: Implement the starting model containing `Airport` nodes.
* *Exercise 2.2*: Display the nodes and relationships in the graph.
* *Exercise 2.3*: Query the graph.

== Exercise 2.1: Implement the starting model containing `Airport` nodes (Instructions)

Here is the starting airport model:

*Write and execute the Cypher code to create the nodes and relationships for this simple airport model.*

*Hint*: Since you have a small amount of data here, you can use CREATE if you ensure the nodes and relationships you create are unique.

== Exercise 2.1: Implement the starting model containing `Airport` nodes  (Solution)

Here is the starting airport model:

*Write and execute the Cypher code to create the nodes and relationships for this simple airport model.*

*Hint*: Since you have a small amount of data here, you can use CREATE if you ensure the nodes and relationships you create are unique.

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE
  (`0` :Airport {code:'LAS'}) ,
  (`1` :Airport {code:'LAX'}) ,
  (`2` :Airport {code:'ABQ'}) ,
  (`0`)-[:`CONNECTED_TO` {airline:'WN',flightNumber:'82',date:'2019-1-3',departure:'1715',arrival:'1820'}]->(`1`),
  (`0`)-[:`CONNECTED_TO` {airline:'WN',flightNumber:'500',date:'2019-1-3',departure:'1445',arrival:'1710'}]->(`2`)
----

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 2.2: Display the newly-created nodes (Instructions)

*Write and execute a Cypher query to return all nodes in the graph.*

== Exercise 2.2: Display the newly-created nodes (Solution)

*Write and execute a Cypher query to return all nodes in the graph.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n)
RETURN n
----

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 2.3: Query the graph (Instructions)

*Write and execute a Cypher query to return all connections leaving LAS.*

== Exercise 2.3: Query the graph (Solution)

*Write and execute a Cypher query to return all connections leaving LAS.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH connection = (:Airport {code: 'LAS'})-[:CONNECTED_TO]->(:Airport)
RETURN connection
----

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 2: Getting started with the airport graph data model (Summary)

In this exercise, you created the initial graph for the airport graph data model that you will be working with.
This graph is just a start. In the next exercise you will load more data into the graph.
