//.Goals
//[abstract]
//{description}
This guide uses a specific data set, but the principles in this guide can be applied and reused with any data domain.

//.Prerequisites
//[abstract]

== Prerequisites

You need not have any prior experience with Cypher to perform the steps of this Guide.

== Before you begin

You should start with an empty database. Execute this code to clear the database:

[source, cypher]
----
// Delete all constraints and indexes
CALL apoc.schema.assert({},{},true);
// Delete all nodes and relationships
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
  'MATCH (n) RETURN n',
  'DETACH DELETE n',
  { batchSize:500 }
)
----

You should now have no nodes or relationships in the database:

== What is a graph?

* Nodes (with labels)
* Relationships
* Properties


== Nodes

* Nouns in your model
* Represent the objects or entities in the graph
* Can have one or more labels:
** Person
** House
** Location

== Relationships

* Verbs in your model
* Represent the connection between nodes in the graph
* Have a type:
** MARRIED
** LIVES_AT
** OWNS
* Have direction

== Properties

* Adjectives to describe nodes
* Adverbs to describe relationships
* Property:
** Key/value pair
** Can be optional or required
** Can be unique for nodes
** Have a type such as numeric, string, boolean, etc.
