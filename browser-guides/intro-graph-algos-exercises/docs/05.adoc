== Exercise 5: Strongly Connected Components (Preparations)

The database you start with should contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup steps again.

== Exercise 5: Strongly Connected Components (Overview)

In this exercise, you will gain some experience with writing Cypher for the strongly connected graph algorithm using the European Roads dataset.

* *Exercise 5.1*: View the European Roads dataset schema.
* *Exercise 5.2*: Find all strongly connected *Place* nodes.
* *Exercise 5.3*: Verify results of strongly connected execution.

== Exercise 5.1: View the European Roads dataset schema. (Instructions)

The European Roads dataset contains *Place* nodes that are connected by the *EROAD* relationship. Write a query to view some of the nodes and relationships in this dataset. What are the properties?

== Exercise 5.1: View the European Roads dataset schema. (Solution)

The European Roads dataset contains *Place* nodes that are connected by the *EROAD* relationship. Write a query to view some of the nodes and relationships in this dataset. What are the properties?

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Place)-[:EROAD]-(p2:Place)
RETURN p, p2 LIMIT 10
----

The results returned should look like this:

The properties for a *Place* node are *name* and *countryCode*.

The properties for an *EROAD* relationship are *distance*, *road_number*, and *watercrossing*.

== Exercise 5.2: Find all strongly connected Place nodes (Instructions)

A strongly connected node is one where there is a path both  in and out of a node to another node in the graph. Write a query to return the nodes for each strongly connected partition in the graph for the *Place* nodes and the *EROAD* relationship.

*Hint*: You will use `algo.scc.stream`.

== Exercise 5.2: Find all strongly connected Place nodes (Solution)

A strongly connected node is one where there is a path both  in and out of a node to another node in the graph. Write a query to return the nodes for each strongly connected partition in the graph for the *Place* nodes and the *EROAD* relationship.

*Hint*: You will use `algo.scc.stream`.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.scc.stream("Place", "EROAD")
YIELD nodeId, partition
RETURN partition, collect(algo.getNodeById(nodeId).name) AS places
ORDER BY size(places) DESC
----

The results returned should look like this:

== Exercise 5.3: Verify results of strongly connected execution. (Instructions)

Using the data that was returned, pick a partition and write a query to return all nodes in that partition by checking whether the name of the node matches what was returned from the execution of the algorithm.

== Exercise 5.3: Verify results of strongly connected execution. (Solution)

Using the data that was returned, pick a partition and write a query to return all nodes in that partition by checking whether the name of the node matches what was returned from the execution of the algorithm.

Here is a query to return all nodes in a partition containing four Place nodes:

[source]
----
MATCH (x:Place) WHERE
x.name IN ["Aveiro", "Coimbra", "Lisboa", "Santarem", "Leiria"]
RETURN x
----

The results should be:

Here we see that every *Place* node has a path to and from it to get to any other node in the partition.

== Exercise 5: Strongly Connected Components: Taking it further

. Try using different configuration values.
. Try using the stream version of the algorithm.

== Exercise 5: Strongly Connected Components (Summary)

In this exercise, you gained some experience with writing Cypher for the strongly connected graph algorithm using the European Roads dataset.
