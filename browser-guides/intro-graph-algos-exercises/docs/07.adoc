== Exercise 7: PageRank (Preparations)

The database you start with should contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup steps again.

== Exercise 7: PageRank (Overview)

PageRank measures the transitive influence or connectivity of nodes.
It can be computed by iteratively distributing one node’s rank (originally based on degree) over its neighbors.

In this exercise, you will analyze PageRank for the European Roads dataset:

* *Exercise 7.1*: Perform the PageRank algorithm on the *Place* nodes and *EROADS* relationships.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Exercise 7.1: Perform the PageRank algorithm on the *Place* nodes and *EROADS* relationships. (Instructions)

Write Cypher code to perform PageRank analysis on the *Place* nodes using the *EROADS* relationship using these guidelines:

* Use the stream variation of the algorithm.
* Specify 2 iterations.
* Specify both directions.
* Specify a dampening factor of .85.
* Return the results ordering by *score*.

*Hint*: Call `algo.pageRank.stream`.

== Exercise 7.1: Perform the PageRank algorithm on the *Place* and *EROADS* relationships. (Solution)

Write Cypher code to perform PageRank analysis on the *Place* nodes using the *EROADS* relationship using these guidelines:

* Use the stream variation of the algorithm.
* Specify 20 iterations.
* Specify both directions.
* Specify a dampening factor of .85.
* Return the results ordering by *score*.

*Hint*: Call `algo.pageRank.stream`.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.pageRank.stream('Place', 'EROAD', {iterations:20, dampingFactor:0.85, direction: "BOTH"})
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN algo.getNodeById(nodeId).name AS page, score
ORDER BY score DESC
----

The results returned should look like this:

Here we see that Berlin, Munchen, and Paris are the most popular places.

== Exercise 7: PageRank: Taking it further

. Change the iterations and dampening factor to see how it affects the results.
. Try using the non-stream version of the algorithm.

== Exercise 7: PageRank (Summary)

PageRank measures the transitive influence or connectivity of nodes.
It can be computed by iteratively distributing one node’s rank (originally based on degree) over its neighbors.

In this exercise, you analyzed PageRank for the European Roads dataset.
