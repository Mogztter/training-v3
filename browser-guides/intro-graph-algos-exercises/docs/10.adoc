== Exercise 10: Similarity (Preparations)

The database you start with should contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

image::DatabaseAfterExercise9.png[DatabaseAfterExercise9,width=150]

Your database should contain more relationships that were created in Exercise 9. These new relationships are not required for the remainder of these exercises, but you should, at a minimum, have the nodes and relationships that you set up earlier for this course.

== Exercise 10: Similarity (Overview)

Similarity algorithms are useful for analyzing datasets to determine how alike nodes are based upon their properties.

In this exercise, you will execute some Similarity algorithms on the Yelp dataset:

* *Exercise 10.1*: Run the Overlap Similarity algorithm on some sample data.
* *Exercise 10.2*: Run the Overlap Similarity algorithm for categories of businesses in the Yelp dataset.
* *Exercise 10.3*: Modify and view the updated graph after running the Overlap Similarity algorithm.
* *Exercise 10.4*: Run the Pearson Similarity algorithm for users who have reviewed businesses.
* *Exercise 10.5*: Run the Jaccard Similarity algorithm for photos that have been similarly tagged.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Exercise 10.1: Run the Overlap Similarity algorithm on some sample data. (Instructions/Solution)

Suppose  you want to compute the similarity of categories based on the same businesses being tagged with that category.
First, see how the algorithm works with some dummy data by executing this code:

[source, cypher]
----
WITH [
  {item: 7, categories: [10,11,12]},
  {item: 8, categories: [10,11]},
  {item: 9, categories: [11,12,13,14,15]}
] AS data
CALL algo.similarity.overlap.stream(data)
YIELD item1, item2, similarity
RETURN item1, item2, similarity
ORDER BY similarity DESC
----

In this query, dataset, item 8 has a similarity score of 1.0 with item 7, which means that item 8 is a complete subset of item 7.
Item 7 itself is a subset of item 9, but it is not a complete subset as item 7 has one category that item 9 does not.

== Exercise 10.2: Run the Overlap Similarity algorithm for categories of businesses in the Yelp dataset. (Instructions)

Now you will run the algorithm on the Yelp dataset.
First, you need to build a collection of items like you did in the previous example, but this time the collection will consist of data from our graph rather than being hard-coded.

This code provides a template for computing the Overlap Similarity of categories based on the businesses tagged with those categories:

[source, cypher]
----
// Change this part of the query
MATCH (book:Book)-[:HAS_GENRE]->(genre)
WITH {item:id(genre), categories: collect(id(book))} as userData

WITH collect(userData) as data

// Fill in the config in this part of the query
CALL algo.similarity.overlap(data, {

})

YIELD nodes, similarityPairs, p50, p75, p90, p99
RETURN nodes, similarityPairs, p50, p75, p90, p99
----

Modify this code to:

* Compute similarity between categories based on the business tagged with that category.
  *Hint*: You will use the *IN_CATEGORY* relationship.

* Choose a similarity cut off value.
  *Hint*: Use the *similarityCutOff* configuration parameter.

* Store the results in the graph.
  *Hint*: Use the *write* configuration parameter.

== Exercise 10.2: Run the Overlap Similarity algorithm for categories of businesses in the Yelp dataset. (Solution)

Now you will run the algorithm on the Yelp dataset.
First, you need to build a collection of items like you did in the previous example, but this time the collection will consist of data from our graph rather than being hard-coded.

This code provides a template for computing the Overlap Similarity of categories based on the businesses tagged with those categories:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (category:Category)<-[:IN_CATEGORY]-(business)
WITH {item:id(category), categories: collect(id(business))} AS userData

WITH collect(userData) as data

CALL algo.similarity.overlap(data, {
  write: true, similarityCutoff: 0.75
})

YIELD nodes, similarityPairs, p50, p75, p90, p99
RETURN nodes, similarityPairs, p50, p75, p90, p99;
----

Modify this code to:

* Compute similarity between categories based on the business tagged with that category.
  *Hint*: You will use the *IN_CATEGORY* relationship.

* Choose a similarity cut off value.
  *Hint*: Use the *similarityCutOff* configuration parameter.

* Store the results in the graph.
  *Hint*: Use the *write* configuration parameter.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (category:Category)<-[:IN_CATEGORY]-(business)
WITH {item:id(category), categories: collect(id(business))} AS userData

WITH collect(userData) as data

CALL algo.similarity.overlap(data, {
  write: true, similarityCutoff: 0.75
})

YIELD nodes, similarityPairs, p50, p75, p90, p99
RETURN nodes, similarityPairs, p50, p75, p90, p99
----

The results returned should look like this:

image::EX10.2.png[EX10.2,width=600]

== Exercise 10.3: Modify and view the updated graph after running the Overlap Similarity algorithm. (Instructions/Solution)

The algorithm you just ran created relationships between nodes that are not strictly adjacent in the hierarchy.
Run this code to remove those transitive relationships:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (g1:Category)-[:NARROWER_THAN*2..]->(g3:Category),
      (g1)-[d:NARROWER_THAN]->(g3)
DELETE d
----

View the hierarchy that has been created. Execute this query return 10 of these paths:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH path = (category:Category)-[:NARROWER_THAN*]->(superCategory:Category)
RETURN path
LIMIT 10
----

Note that top-level categories do not have an outgoing *NARROWER_THAN* relationship.


== Exercise 10.4: Run the Pearson Similarity algorithm for users who have reviewed businesses. (Instructions)

You want to see the similarity between users who reviewed businesses.

The query below provides a template for computing the Pearson Similarity of users based on the businesses that they have reviewed.

[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.similarity.pearson(
  "MATCH (u:User)
   WHERE size((u)-[:WROTE]->()) > 15
   // Fill in this part of the query
   RETURN id(u) AS item, id(business) AS category, review.stars AS weight",
  {graph: "cypher", skipValue: algo.NaN()})
----

Modify this code to:

* Compute similarity between users based on the common businesses they have reviewed
  *Hint*: You will need to use the *WROTE* and *REVIEWS* relationships.

* Choose a similarity cut off value.
  *Hint*: Use the *similarityCutOff* configuration parameter.

* Choose a topK value.
  *Hint*: Use the *topK* configuration parameter.

* Store the results in the graph.
  *Hint*: Use the *write* configuration parameter.

== Exercise 10.4: Run the Pearson Similarity algorithm for users who have reviewed businesses. (Solution)

   WHERE size((u)-[:WROTE]->()) > 15
   // Fill in this part of the query
   RETURN id(u) AS item, id(business) AS category, review.stars AS weight",
  {graph: "cypher", skipValue: algo.NaN()})
----

Modify this code to:

* Compute similarity between users based on the common businesses they have reviewed
  *Hint*: You will need to use the *WROTE* and *REVIEWS* relationships.

  *Hint*: Use the *similarityCutOff* configuration parameter.

* Choose a topK value.
  *Hint*: Use the *topK* configuration parameter.

* Store the results in the graph.
  *Hint*: Use the *write* configuration parameter.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.similarity.pearson(
 "MATCH (u:User)
  WHERE size((u)-[:WROTE]->()) > 15
  MATCH (u)-[:WROTE]->(review)-[:REVIEWS]->(b)
  RETURN id(u) AS item, id(b) AS category, review.stars as weight",
  {graph: "cypher", topK: 5, skipValue: algo.NaN(), similarityCutoff: 0.1, write: true})
----

The results returned should look like this:

In an application we would use this similarity graph to improve the reviews that we show the user.

Run this command to set this parameter that will hold valid userId values:

[source, cypher]
----
:param userIds => ["FiKaWcORiTyKi4I7pJp3tQ", "d_TBs6J3twMy9GChqUEXkg", "NwPnvTALYMNZgdiwHHkuAQ"]
----

Run this query to find similar users by following the *SIMILAR* relationship from the first user:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User {id: $userIds[0]})-[similarity:SIMILAR]->(other)
RETURN other, similarity.score AS similarity
ORDER BY similarity DESC
----

The results returned should look like this:

== Exercise 10.5: Run the Jaccard Similarity algorithm for photos that have been similarly tagged. (Instructions)

The photos in this graph have been run through Googleâ€™s Image Labeling service and those labels are connected to photos by the *HAS_LABEL* relationship.
Run the following query to explore this part of the graph:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH path = (p:Photo)-[:HAS_LABEL]->(label)
RETURN path
LIMIT 25
----

We want to determine which photos are similar to each other based on the labels they have been tagged with.
You can do this using the Jaccard Similarity algorithm. Here is the starting template for the code:

[source, cypher]
----
// Change this part of the query
MATCH (p:Person)-[likes:LIKES]->(cuisine)
WITH {item:id(p), categories: collect(id(cuisine))} as userData

WITH collect(userData) as data

// Fill in the config in this part of the query
CALL algo.similarity.jaccard(data, {

})

YIELD p25, p50, p90, p99, p999, p100,  write
RETURN p25, p50, p90, p99, p999, p100, write
