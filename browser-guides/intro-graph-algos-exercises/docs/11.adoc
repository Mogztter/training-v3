== Exercise 11: Link Prediction (Preparations)

This exercise will use a very small sample graph.

Execute this code to load the nodes and relationships into the graph:

[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND [["A", "C"], ["A", "B"], ["B", "D"],
        ["B", "C"], ["B", "E"], ["C", "D"]] AS pair
MERGE (n1:Node {name: pair[0]})
MERGE (n2:Node {name: pair[1]})
MERGE (n1)-[:HAS_FRIEND]-(n2)
----

This graph should look as follows:

== Exercise 11: Link Prediction (Overview)

Link Prediction algorithms are useful applications that recommend outcomes and for machine learning.

In this exercise, you will gain some experience with Link Prediction algorithms on small sample graph of *Node* nodes with the *HAS_FRIEND* relationships:

* *Exercise 11.1*: Run the Common Neighbors algorithm.
* *Exercise 11.2*: Run the Adamic Adar algorithm.
* *Exercise 11.3*: Run the Preferential Attachment algorithm.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Exercise 11.1: Run the Common Neighbors algorithm. (Instructions/Solution)

The common-neighbors predictor captures the notion that two strangers who have a common friend may be introduced by that friend. This introduction has the effect of "closing a triangle" in the graph.

As the name suggests, this measure computes the number of common neighbors that a pair of nodes share. We want to compute the similarity of categories based on the same businesses being tagged with that category.

First, run this algorithm as a function by executing this code:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Node {name: 'A'})
MATCH (d:Node {name: 'D'})
RETURN algo.linkprediction.commonNeighbors(a, d) AS score
----

This function returns a score of 2 meaning that nodes A and D have two nodes in common.

Modify this query to find the score for nodes A and E.

== Exercise 11.2: Run the Adamic Adar algorithm. (Instructions/Solution)

Now you will perform link prediction over all the nodes in our sample graph.
Run this code that computes Adamic Adar for all pairs of nodes that do not have a *HAS_FRIEND* relationship:
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Node), (b:Node)
WHERE a <> b AND a.name < b.name AND not((a)-[:HAS_FRIEND]-(b))
RETURN a.name, b.name, algo.linkprediction.adamicAdar(a, b) AS score
ORDER BY score DESC
----

Which pair of nodes are more likely to have a link created between them?

== Exercise 11.3: Run the Preferential Attachment algorithm. (Instructions/Solution)

The intuition is that nodes with many relationships will gain more relationships.

This measure is one of the easiest to computeâ€Šby taking the product of the degree of each node.

Run this code that computes Preferential Attachment score for nodes C and E:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Node {name: 'C'})
MATCH (d:Node {name: 'E'})
RETURN algo.linkprediction.preferentialAttachment(a, d) AS score
----

== Exercise 11: Link Prediction: Taking it further

Perform some Link Prediction analysis with some of the larger datasets in your database.

== Exercise 11: Link Prediction (Summary)

Link Prediction algorithms are useful applications that recommend outcomes and for machine learning.

In this exercise, you gained some experience with Link Prediction algorithms on small sample graph of *Node* nodes with the *HAS_FRIEND* relationships.
