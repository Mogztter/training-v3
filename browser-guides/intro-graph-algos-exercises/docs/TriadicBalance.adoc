== Triadic Balance (Preparations) (LEAVE OUT because library code fails)

The database you start with should contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup steps again.

== Triadic Balance (Overview)

The Triadic Balance  is an algorithm that counts the number of balanced and unbalanced triads a node is member of.
It uses a signed graph model to differentiate between positive and negative relationships using the sign of the weight.

In this exercise, you will analyze the Triadic Balance for the Game of Thrones (GOT) dataset:

* *Part 1*: Prepare the graph for analysis by assigning balance scores for each relationship.
* *Part 2*: Run the Triadic Balance algorithm.
* *Part 3*: Examine the results of running the algorithm.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Part 1: Prepare the graph for analysis by assigning balance scores for each relationship. (Instructions)

The GOT dataset has *Character* nodes that are related to each other using the *INTERACTS_SEASONn* relationship.
In this graph, these relationships have a *weight* property.

Write Cypher code to modify each *INTERACTS_SEASON1* relationship so that it has a new property, *weightScore*.
The value for *weightScore* will be 1 if *weight* is greater than the mean for all *ITERACTS_SEASON1* relationships, otherwise it will be -1.

*Hint*: Use `avg()` to compute the mean for all relationships.

== Part 1: Prepare the graph for analysis by assigning balance scores for each relationship. (Solution)

The GOT dataset has *Character* nodes that are related to each other using the *INTERACTS_SEASONn* relationship.
In this graph, these relationships have a *weight* property.

Write Cypher code to modify each *INTERACTS_SEASON1* relationship so that it has a new property, *weightScore*.
The value for *weightScore* will be 1 if *weight* is greater than the mean for all *ITERACTS_SEASON1* relationships, otherwise it will be -1.

*Hint*: Use `avg()` to compute the mean for all relationships.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH ()-[r:INTERACTS_SEASON1]-()
WITH avg(r.weight) AS mean
MATCH ()-[r:INTERACTS_SEASON1]-()
WITH r, CASE WHEN r.weight > mean THEN 1 ELSE -1 END as balanceWeight
SET r.weightScore = balanceWeight
----

The results returned should look like this:

== Part 2: Run the Triadic Balance algorithm. (Instructions)

Write the Cypher code to calculate the Triadic Balance for the *Character* nodes with the *INTERACTS_SEASON1* relationship using the *weightScore* property as the weight property.

== Part 2: Run the Triadic Balance algorithm. (Solution)

Write the Cypher code to calculate the Triadic Balance for the *Character* nodes with the *INTERACTS_SEASON1* relationship using the *weightScore* property as the weight property.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.balancedTriads('Character', 'INTERACTS_SEASON1',
{concurrency:4, write:true, weightProperty:'weightScore', balancedProperty:'balanced',
unbalancedProperty:'unbalanced'})
YIELD loadMillis, computeMillis, writeMillis, nodeCount, balancedTriadCount,
unbalancedTriadCount
----

The results returned should look like this:

== Part 3: Examine the results of running the algorithm. (Instructions)

Write a query to find all characters who are in more unbalanced triads than balanced ones.

== Part 3: Examine the results of running the algorithm. (Solution)

Write a query to find all characters who are in more unbalanced triads than balanced ones.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Character) WHERE n.unbalanced > n.balanced
RETURN n.name, n.unbalanced, n.balanced ORDER BY n.unbalanced DESC LIMIT 100
----

The results returned should look like this:

== Triadic Balance: Taking it further

. Try using the stream version of the algorithm.
. Perform the analysis of different seasons.

== Triadic Balance (Summary)

The Triadic Balance  is an algorithm that counts the number of balanced and unbalanced triads a node is member of.
It uses a signed graph model to differentiate between positive and negative relationships using the sign of the weight.

In this exercise, you analyzed  the Triadic Balance for the Game of Thrones (GOT) dataset.
