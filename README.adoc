This repo will use the Gradle tool chain for building the following for Courses:

- HTML for online courses
- HTML for enrollment pages
- HTML for reveal.js slide presentations
- PDF

This repo will use the Gradle tool chain for building the following for Browser Guides:

- HTML Neo Browser guides
- PDF

== Structure of the repo

[square]
* *modules* each directory is a course or a browser guide which contains:
** *modules*          the modules list of the Antora documentation component (contains AsciiDoc source files)
** *docs*             the AsciiDoc source files
** *images*           the images
** *single-pdf*       container for generating the course guide or exercise guide
** *single-slides*    container for generating a single HTML for the entire course
** *build*            generated when you convert AsciiDoc which contains these important artifacts
*** *enrollment*      the HTML for the enrollment page
*** *online*          the online HTML and the PDF for each lesson of the course
*** *slides*          the HTML slides for each lesson of the course
*** *single-pdf*      the PDF for the course guide or exercise guide
*** *single-slides*   the HTML slides for the entire course

== Prerequisites

Since we are using the {uri-gradle-wrapper}[Gradle Wrapper], the only requirement is to have {uri-java-download}[Java] installed.

> A Java version between 8 and 13 is required to execute Gradle. Java 14 and later versions are not yet supported.

https://docs.gradle.org/6.0/release-notes.html

== Using the Gradle Wrapper

On Windows, open a terminal and type:

 $ gradlew.bat

On Linux and macOS, open a terminal and type:

 $ ./gradlew

If you run this command for the first time it will download and install Gradle.
Make sure that you have an unrestricted access to Internet (ie. not behind a corporate proxy).

== Tasks

In the following examples, we are going to use the command `./gradlew`.
If you are using Windows, don't forget to replace `./gradlew` by `gradlew.bat`.

.Convert to HTML
 $ ./gradlew convertOnlineHtml

.Convert to PDF
 $ ./gradlew convertOnlinePdf

.Convert to reveal.js
 $ ./gradlew convertSlides

All the generated files will be available at [.path]_modules/\{moduleName}/build_.

If you want to convert all the files at once, you can use the `convert` task:

 $ ./gradlew convert

You can also run a task on a specific module:

 $ #./gradlew <nameOfModule>:<task>

For example:

 $ ./gradlew 4.0-intro-neo4j:convertSlides
 $ ./gradlew 4.0-intro-neo4j:convert

If you want to create a single slide deck for a group of slide AsciiDoc files, make a folder named "single-slides".
In that folder include the AsciiDoc for the group of files you want to combine. (see example in 4.0-intro-neo4j module)
Then use this command to build it:

 $ #./gradlew <nameOfModule>:convertSingleSlides

There is similar functionality for consolidating PDFs. It uses the folder "single-pdf". The caution with generating a large PDF, however is memory. If you have a large PDF that you want to produce, you may need to install mogrify.

 $ #./gradlew <nameOfModule>:convertSinglePdf

Gradle will do his best to detect if a task needs to be run again or not.
If you want to force Gradle to execute a task again, you can remove the `build` directory using the `clean` task:

 $ ./gradlew clean

Once the `build` directory is removed, type the task you want to execute.

You can also clean a particular module which removes the *build* folder for that module:

 $ #./gradlew <nameOfModule>:clean

== LiveReload

To enable {uri-livereload}[LiveReload], you will need to install the {uri-livereload-webstore}[LiveReload browser extension] on Chrome.
Once it's done you should have a new icon on the right of your address bar:

image::livereload-icon.png[]

Next, you need to open two terminal.
In the first one, type the following command to continuously convert the AsciiDoc source to a reveal.js presentation:

 $ #./gradlew --continuous <nameOfModule>:convertSlides

On the second one, type the following command to start the LiveReload server on the [.path]_demo_ module:

[source,console]
----
$ #./gradlew <nameOfModule>:liveReload

> Task :liveReload
Enabling LiveReload at port 35729 for /path/to/modules/demo/build
----

You're all set!

Now, open Chrome and navigate to the HTML file of your choice, for instance: http://localhost:35729/slides/04_IntroductionToCypherPresentation.html.
Don't forget to enable the LiveReload extension on your browser by clicking on the icon:

image::livereload-enabled.png[]

Notice that the middle circle is now filled in black.

If you edit the corresponding AsciiDoc source (or resources), and wait a few seconds, your browser will automatically be refreshed with your changes.

== Add a new module

To add a new module, edit the [.path]_settings.gradle_ file at the root of this project.
For instance, if we want to add a new module named `browser" located at [.path]_modules/browser-guides_, we need to add the following lines:

[source,gradle]
----
include 'browser'
project(':browser').projectDir = file('modules/browser-guides')
----

Now we can execute tasks on this new module, for instance:

[source,console]
----
$ ./gradlew browser:convert
----

== Viewing slides locally

1. In a terminal window, navigate to the folder where the slides HTML resides, for example:

 cd modules/demo/build/slides

2. Open the an HTML page in JS-enabled Browser
+
[square]
* `ESC` to see summary slides
* Page down/Page up to move from slide to slide
* Option + Click to zoom in/zoom out
* S to open speaker notes in a different window

== Antora Local preview

As a prerequisite, you will need to install the latest LTS of https://nodejs.org/[Node.js].
Once `node` and `npm` are installed, open a terminal and type:

 $ npm i
 $ npm i --prefix resources/site-generator

The above commands will install the dependencies.

=== Tasks

Build and publish the site in _public/graphacademy_ directory:

 $ npm run build

Start a local server to serve the _public/graphacademy_ directory:

 $ npm run start

Continuously watch, build and serve the site:

 $ npm run watch

[TIP]
====
It can take quite some time to build all the courses everytime.
To get a snappier experience, we recommend using the envrionment variable `TRAINING_MODULE` to build only one course.
For instance, if we are working on the `datascience` course:

 $ TRAINING_MODULE=datascience npm run watch
